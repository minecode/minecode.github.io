Although they arrive with the same level of mathematical education, different levels of mathematical and statistical knowledges and diverse relations to math and statistical topics are recognized among them. In the last year students claimed more statistical exercises to help them to see the different perspectives of a statistical concept and, also, more advanced exercises to challenge the very well prepared students. Moreover, recent summative assessments revealed the lack of mathematical bases and, for many students, Biostatistics will be the only mathematical course in the graduation. In parallel, the number of university degrees having Biostatistics has double as well as the number of students and this also contributed for more diverse previous backgrounds on stats and mathematics. Another source of change is that the education politics in Portugal have recently been changed and this affected the preparation in the field of statistics.\r\n\r\n![softboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17366849/79807568-3c023500-8363-11ea-9cb5-2bf8baa9d96b.png)\r\n\r\nConsidering all of these changes, diversity of knowledge, skill and competence in mathematics, and the demand from students, a new way of helping the teaching / learning process is necessary. However, instead of starting by renew and produce new paper (or pdf) materials, we decide to setup an holistic web based learning approach to the diverse preparation levels consisting of two components: (i) a wiki-like text ebook whose contents are well structured and interconnected using hyperlinks and (ii) a companion web-based platform, called here as ‘softscience’, containing the same practice ‘paper exercises’ offered to students in last years, but also populated with new exercises about the mathematical and statistical background concepts. Considering well prepared students more advanced challenges were added to the platform. Each of these study problems have hyperlinks on the body of the question to the study materials online and, also, in the several subquestions. A ‘suggestion’ button can lead the student to materials that are not easily depicted from the problem body leading the student to know what to study if the problem is too challenging for him/her. We decide to avoid presentation of full answers of ‘official’ exercises; only background problems have full detailed answers.\r\n\r\nThe results of two simple online surveys launched via moodle, as pretest and postest, were analysed to assessing the opinion of students about physical versus online materials for studying. For pretest version, three questions were posed evaluating the “advantages of paper study materials”, the “advantages of study materials being on pdf” and, finally, what could be the “advantages of a wikipedia-like materials dedicated to the course”.  Then, the holistic web based learning approach was presented.  Students were allowed to use the platform for several weeks. At the end, the posttest was conducted. A qualitative analysis of the responses allowed to identify attractive features of our learning method to be carried on and improved.","closed_by":{"login":"cfchenr","id":17366849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzY2ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17366849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr","html_url":"https://github.com/cfchenr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},"relatedPosts":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
