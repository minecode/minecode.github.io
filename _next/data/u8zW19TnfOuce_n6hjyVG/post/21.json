So when the time came to create a virtual cluster I saw the list growing before my eyes. Thankfully, for those situations, there is -Ã∂VÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂hÃ∂- Proxmox!\r\n\r\n![Proxmox-VE_1-720x387-720x387](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17366849/79806159-aa44f880-835f-11ea-8c17-6c3f7889ac2c.jpeg)\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*krY60LO1NQqnAKot)\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is Proxmox? And why the strange name?\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAsked nobody. Proxmox is a Virtual Environment Software, which basically means you create simple virtual machines intended to work with each other inside it. And according to WÃ∂iÃ∂kÃ∂iÃ∂ a trusted source, its name chosen for being an available domain at the time of its creation. Kinda kills the mood.\r\n\r\nHow can I set it up?\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nIf you haven‚Äôt guessed it yet, we are going to create a Virtual Machine to host our Virtual Environment. I will leave it up to the reader to choose the software to do so, since I‚Äôm not getting paid by neither one üòè  \r\nBut one thing we all need is the Proxmox Virtual Environment ISO, which can be found here:\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/iso-images-pve)\r\n\r\nOn Oracle‚Äôs VirtualBox, I created a new Virtual Machine and chose a name and a folder for it. The client type should be ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù and the version ‚ÄúDebian (64-bit)‚Äù.\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/942/1*icS-odo36XVg-1mSNTi41A.png)\r\n\r\nGive it a good amount of RAM and disk size, since it will be hosting many machines.\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/944/1*bSbJPh9Bq9FVwx3UXohVIw.png)\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1042/1*oCOjOrJURsYZg5I9UXsYjA.png)\r\n\r\nOn our VM Settings lets ‚Äúinsert‚Äù the ISO we just downloaded on the CD slot (on Storage, for the ones using Oracle‚Äôs VM tool). And boot it up!\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1284/1*jDQBRDQ3_N1mrXDtXLM8CA.png)\r\n\r\nWe want to go the ‚ÄúInstall Proxmox VE‚Äù way, agree with the End User Agreement and select our country :)\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-46MR3kUVAGrvZZS-tChwA.png)\r\n\r\nNow we choose a password, input our email and let‚Äôs get to the serious stuff!\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Fr6Glnc35cu6YMlbPw4VJg.png)\r\n\r\nMake sure to select the proper Gateway and DNS Server for your network, aswell as choosing an IP Address that‚Äôs available inside it. Just don‚Äôt forget the address you chose and then simply click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.\r\n\r\nWhen it asks you to reboot itself, allow it. After it‚Äôs done, it will prompt you for login. The username is **root** and the password is the one you defined earlier.\r\n\r\n![Proxmox](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*QM4rGclDz4TLwAUYTsotFA.png)\r\n\r\nInsert the given address in your browser‚Äôs URL box and it should be ready to use!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cfchenr","id":17366849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzY2ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17366849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr","html_url":"https://github.com/cfchenr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},"relatedPosts":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
