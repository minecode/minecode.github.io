Their purpose is to simplify how you get data from the internet. You create your own service that serves data in a nice format (mostly JSON, nowadays) to whoever wants to use it. It’s a pretty simple concept and we’re going to show you that is pretty simple to create one also.\r\n\r\n![medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1300/0*wKTa_u6li9oTds69)\r\n\r\nWhat’s LoopBack?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWe’re going to use LoopBack to create our API, mostly because it simplifies the whole process. LoopBack is a framework that asks us for the costumizable values (such as names) and does the rest. Keep it simple, you know?\r\n\r\nProject Creation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nYou should have Node.JS and a bash terminal installed, both of which you can learn how install on my [last article](https://medium.com/@tiago.slucas/create-your-own-server-with-node-js-5dc02dd030f2). The first thing we’re going to do is create an empty folder and navigate into it using our terminal.\r\n\r\nInstalling LoopBack is as easy as writing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g loopback-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating our project can now be done using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlb\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may take a little, but it should prompt us to give our project a name. Mine will be **loopback\\_api**. Using the arrow keys to select, choose version **2.x** and **api-server**.\r\n\r\n![medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bOh-M67NMtEPBNMzo1a2vA.png)\r\n\r\nNext step is to create a model. You could guess, but that’s easy aswell. Just type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlb model\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will give you some choices, but we mainly click Enter and go forward. I choose a model name of **loopback\\_model**, with **no datasource**, a standart **model**, no custom plural form and **common** for access everywhere. Added a property called **nombre** of type **string**, **required** with **no default**. And we’re set!\r\n\r\nWhat’s left for us to do is just running our server. Just type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n node .\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen your browser and go to the url:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou’ve just built your own API! If this is so simple, what are kids studying for?\r\n\r\n![medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ljfvmDmjmNsLyJicGrwGpg.png)","closed_by":{"login":"cfchenr","id":17366849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzY2ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17366849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr","html_url":"https://github.com/cfchenr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfchenr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},"relatedPosts":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
