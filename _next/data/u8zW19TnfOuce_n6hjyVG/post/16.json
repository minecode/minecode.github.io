**minecode** community aims to unite people with distinct backgrounds and experiences by sharing opinions on articles in our blog.\r\n\r\nThe project intends to make the most of the resources made available by **Github**, using its API and repositories as a source of data and thus build a website totally free and without maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n![HC-Trailblazer-Software-Developer-1024x675](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17366849/79802751-74e8dc80-8358-11ea-91eb-97f8a7d2effd.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe also use the actions provided by **Github** to automate some tasks, namely the creation of pull requests, releases and the deployment of the application.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage there are still many things to be defined and we are receptive to new opinions and ideas for this project.\r\n\r\nIn the future we intend to expand the number of bloggers and contributors on our site, create a social network to share projects, filtering them by geographical location, thus allowing people from the same area and with common interests in certain projects to get in touch.\r\n\r\nTo follow the progress of the project just access [issues](https://github.com/minecode/minecode.github.io/issues). In the future we intend to implement in our website a system that organizes our ideas (issues) and presents them to the whole community, contributing to centralize in our website all the information, ideas, projects, articles and everything else that arises.\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the project, take a look at [our repository](https://github.com/minecode/website) and put your suggestions there.
